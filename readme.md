# Renewable Energy System Model Validation with MATLAB/Simulink

This example walks through the validation process for renewable energy systems using replay of field data. The process involves both manual and automated parameter tuning, resulting in a digital twin representation which emulates real system response.

## Video Walkthrough of Example:
For more information and a video walk-through, these examples are used in the "Renewable Energy Power Plant Model Validation" video: https://www.mathworks.com/videos/renewable-energy-power-plant-model-validation-1572378243901.html

## Getting Started with this Example:
To run this demo:
1. Run the PPMV_Renewables.prj to star the project
2. The folder structure walks through the material.
